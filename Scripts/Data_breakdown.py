# Date: The trading day for the data point. (YYYY-MM-DD format is standard).
# Close Price: The price at which the stock last traded on that day. This is the most critical data point and is required for all your calculations.

# Good to have data

# Open Price: The price at the beginning of the trading day.
# High Price: The highest intraday price.
# Low Price: The lowest intraday price.
# Volume: The number of shares traded that day.
# Adjusted Close Price: This is especially important for long-term analysis. It accounts for corporate actions like stock splits, dividends, and rights offerings. It adjusts all historical prices to be comparable to the current price, giving a true picture of returns. Always use the Adjusted Close for return calculations if available.
